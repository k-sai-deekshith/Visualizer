**Algorithms Visualizer for Finding Spanning Trees and Paths**
**Introduction**
Welcome to the Algorithms Visualizer, an interactive tool designed for visualizing spanning trees and paths. This project was developed to provide an intuitive understanding of complex algorithmic concepts, focusing on Eulerian Trails in both directed and undirected graphs.

**Implementation Highlights**
React Components: Utilized React for building a dynamic and interactive user interface. Key components include App.jsx, Home.jsx, MainPage.jsx, and specific components for visualizing Eulerian Trails.
Illustration Techniques: Leveraged advanced drawing techniques to create a clear and engaging visualization of algorithmic processes.
Tools and Technologies: This project is built using ReactJS, with additional utilities from KendoReact and various Node packages.

**Running the Application**
To run the web-app:

Clone the repository: git clone 
Navigate to the client directory and install node modules: npm i or npm install
Start the client application: npm run dev
In a separate terminal, navigate to the server directory and install node modules: npm i or npm install
Start the server: npm run start
